==============================

Reworked with Lightwave 9.5 and FiberFX, august 08

I know, the head is not very accurate. I wanted to test the simplest option of FiberFX : Fiber pixel filter (through Layout) + "Edit Guides" FiberFX options.

For the head, it would be probably better to create hair through Modeler, with Strand Modeler... but it's a difficult task...
